# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

###Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

>> lists and tuples are a collections of things. Lists are mutable, while tuples are not. Lists work as keys in dictionary since they can be changed later.

---

###Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

>> Lists and sets are collections, lists are ordered while sets are not, objects in sets are also distinct. Lists are very general, while sets are useful for the property of uniqueness. Finding an element presumably is easier in a set, since it is guaranteed to only contain at most 1 of the elemet, so the algorithm can stop when it is found.

###Q3. Lambda Function

Describe Python's `lambda`. What is it, and what is it used for? Give at least one example, including an example of using a `lambda` in the `key` argument to `sorted`.

>> lambda is a quick inline function. sorted(words, key=lambda w: w.lower())

---

###Q4. List Comprehension, Map &amp; Filter

Explain list comprehensions. Give examples and show equivalents with `map` and `filter`. How do their capabilities compare? Also demonstrate set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.

>> List comprehension is an easy way of generating a list.
>> even = [x*2 for x in range(5)]
>> even = list(map(lambda x: x*2,range(5)))
>> even = list(filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, range(10)))
>> Comprehensions can work with simple functions, map work with more complex ones, and filter work better with subsets
>> evenset = {x*2 for x in range(5)}
>> evendict = {x:x*2 for x in range(5)}

###Complete the following problems by editing the files below:

###Q5. Datetime
Use Python to compute days between start and stop date.   
a.  

```
date_start = '01-02-2013'    
date_stop = '07-28-2015'
```

>> 937 days

b.  
```
date_start = '12312013'  
date_stop = '05282015'  
```

>> 513 days

c.  
```
date_start = '15-Jan-1994'      
date_stop = '14-Jul-2015'  
```

>> 7850 days
